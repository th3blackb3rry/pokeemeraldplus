# Feature Plan: Pok√©mon Availablilty

## üß≠ Goal
Adjust the availability of various Pokemon for the sake of improving a Pokemon Emerald playthrough and also making all Pokemon in the Hoenn Dex obtainable in a single game

---

## üß© Scope
This feature will focus on:
- Changing the **Wild Encounters** for various areas in the game
- Changing **Item Placement** that affects Pokemon availability
- Light **Script Editting** for events for previously unobtainable Pokemon


---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation Steps
1. Begin with a **small test batch** of Pok√©mon (e.g., early-game species like Zigzagoon, Lotad, Seedot).
2. Rebuild the ROM after each change and test in an emulator.
3. Document every change in this file as you go.
4. Commit each logical group of edits separately:
   - Wild Encounters
   - Item placements
   - Gifts encounters, etc.
5. Once stable and tested, merge branch into `master`.
